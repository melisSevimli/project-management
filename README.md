# Risk Management Plan - Thyroid Retractor Project

## Identified Risks
| Risk                                   | Impact       | Mitigation Strategy                     |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Prototype printing failure             | Medium       | Allow buffer time; have backup printer access |
| Lack of surgeon availability for feedback | High        | Schedule appointments early; have multiple surgeons contacted |
| CAD model not fitting surgical needs    | High         | Frequent early reviews with clinical advisors |
| Material unsuitable for sterilization   | Medium       | Choose sterilization-safe 3D printing materials |
| Delays due to technical learning curves | Medium       | Parallel task execution; seek online tutorials |

## Contingency Plan
If the initial prototype is non-functional, a second version will be immediately designed and printed within 5 working days.

# Design Requirements - Thyroid Retractor Project

## Functional Requirements
- Provide unobstructed access to the thyroid gland area.
- Be adjustable to different neck sizes.
- Allow easy fixation without causing excessive tissue pressure.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Made of sterilizable materials (or simulated sterilization-safe material for prototype).
- Lightweight (< 300 grams).
- Ergonomic design for surgeon comfort during long procedures.

## Safety Requirements
- No sharp edges that can injure soft tissues.
- Withstand typical surgical force without deformation.

## Usability Requirements
- Setup time under 3 minutes.
- Easy to remove in case of surgical emergencies.

## Environmental Requirements
- Must endure sterilization cycles (autoclave simulation optional for prototype).

# Testing Plan - Thyroid Retractor Project

## Testing Phases
1. **Prototype Testing:**
   - Physical stress tests (manual pulling, bending)
   - Fit simulation on thyroidectomy surgical models

2. **Surgeon Feedback Testing:**
   - Usability assessment from 2-3 surgeons
   - Collect structured feedback (survey form)

3. **Design Refinement:**
   - Adjust based on feedback
   - Re-test modified design

## Acceptance Criteria
- Prototype remains intact under simulated surgical forces.
- Surgeons rate usability as â‰¥ 4 out of 5.
- Setup time remains below 3 minutes.

## Tools/Equipment Needed
- 3D printed prototype
- Surgical model or dummy
- Feedback survey form
